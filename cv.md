## Summary

I've already proved myself as professional in Finance, but am no longer interested in further growth in that domain. Instead, what appeals me now is web app development, amongst other things including, but not limited to: 
1. Modern software development technologies, aimed to deliver the state-of-the-art IT solutions to the client (as opposed to the restrictive MS Excel-based technology stack)
2. Broad coverage of various client industries (as opposed to serving solely the finance & accounting departments)

Working in Finance, I've discovered that developing a solution from tech viewpoint attracts me more than dealing with methodology. Now I feel I'm knocking on IT domain's door.

In search of the best fit to purpose, I've tried .NET WinForms -> then had a swift glance at WPF -> then was inspired by ASP.NET Core & Blazor -> now I'm discovering Angular as being much more mature than Blazor.
